## Description

- Building the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. This is an exercise that practices manipulating the DOM by using conditional logic with core JavaScript. No frameworks were used.

- CSS was not required, but I took some liberties and had fun with it.

### Built with:

- JavaScript - https://www.javascript.com/

- CSS

- HTML
